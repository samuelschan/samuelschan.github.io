            <p class="content">
                The Thursday Discussions are centered around the weekly readings. The aim is to understand both the content and the structure of the readings, and then be able to engage with them in your own writing assignments.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Each week, there will be two leaders; all other students will be participants. However, everyone has to prepare and participate actively. The reason of having leaders is simply to provide some anchors for the discussion.

                The leaders will prepare the following materials, put them in a Word document, and email it to me <span class="red">by Wednesday 11:59pm</span>, a day before you lead:
                <ol>
                    <li>Each leader will write a <u>summary</u> of the reading in 100&#8211;200 words. Don&#8217;t exceed the word limit! Only include what&#8217;s central to the argument. Normally, this will include: the main argument, the methods used, the evidence provided, and the goal(s) that the author wants to achieve. Be as clear and precise as possible, and don&#8217;t add in your own speculations or interpretations.</li>
                    <li>Decide on <u>three important keywords/concepts</u> that represent the reading. Be specific! Don&#8217;t choose words like &#8220;music&#8221; or &#8220;culture&#8221; that are applicable to all the readings that we will encounter.</li>
                    <li>After finishing the first two tasks, stalk the author(s) and gather <u>a list of ten facts</u>. Who are they? What kinds of projects do they work on? What education or musical background do they have? What other texts have they written? What personal stakes do they have for the issue?</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                The participants will prepare the following before section:
                <ol>
                    <li>Highlight the <u>central argument</u> in the reading. Usually, this is only one or two sentence(s).</li>
                    <li>Come up with <u>one example or (counter)argument</u> that either confirms, extends, complicates, or challenges the argument.</li>
                    <li>Think of <u>one way to use this reading</u> in your writing assignments. Basically, ask yourself: What is good or useful about this reading? This can be in various forms: a useful direct quotation (usually a definition or explanation of a key concept), an analysis of a specific example, the central argument as a theoretical basis, the way the author uses/engages with other texts/authors, or a specific writing strategy that you can adopt.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p class="heading">During Section</p>
            <p class="content">
                Each Thursday Discussion will consist of three fifteen-minute segments:
                <ol>
                    <li>Understanding the text: What is the reading about? What isn&#8217;t it about? Collectively, we will come up with an effective summary and define the keywords.</li>
                    <li>Critizing the text: What doesn&#8217;t work in the text?</li>
                    <li>Applying the text: How can we use this reading productively and effectively in our own writing?</li>
                </ol>
