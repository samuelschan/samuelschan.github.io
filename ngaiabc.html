        <p class="heading"><em><em>Ngai</em></em>-ABCs; or, Postcolonial Languaging in the Sinophone</p>
        <p>Samuel Chan</p>
        <p>December 10, 2018</p>

        <p>&ldquo;<em>Ngai</em>-ABCs&rdquo; <span lang="ch">偽</span> ABC (literally, &ldquo;pseudo-ABCs&rdquo; or &ldquo;fake-ABCs&rdquo;) are on the rise. Simply put, this term refers to native-born Hong Kongers who pretend to be American-born Chinese (ABC) expatriates, a phenomenon that seems to become increasingly prevalent. According to the numerous forum posts, journalism, and (mostly sarcastic) how-to guides circulating online, this deliberate act of self-othering is an all-encompassing life choice endeavor: it ranges from clothing (they are said to take pride in wearing American brands like Abercrombie & Fitch or, for younger practitioners, Hollister), hangout spots (Lan Kwai Fong, a bar area in Wanchai that is frequented by expatriates and tourists, is described as their go-to scene), and even work (many are said to be working part-time at Abercrombie or Hollister). However, <em>ngai</em>-ABCs are most typically identified by their routinized use of an assemblage of performative speech acts—to put it crudely, trying (albeit unsuccessfully, hence <em>ngai</em>) to sound like &ldquo;real ABCs&rdquo; by inserting English words and phrases into their Cantonese speech, as well as by adopting certain sonic characteristics of English speakers from the United States (the reason I eschew the term &ldquo;American accent&rdquo; should, hopefully, become apparent below).</p>
        <p>Given its bilingual and voluntary nature, <em>ngai</em>-ABCs complicate everyday conceptions of accents as simply qualifiable by adjectival prefixes that indicate, among other things, geography or nationality (for instance, a &ldquo;Southern accent&rdquo; or a &ldquo;British accent&rdquo;), as well as the related idea that they thus operate under some form of involuntary sociocultural entrainment (&agrave; la Pierre Bourdieu&rsquo;s habitus, as Rey Chow [2014] describes). Instead, this essay argues that <em>ngai</em>-ABCs function as a limit-case that can reveal the inner workings of &ldquo;accent-proper&rdquo; in monolingual—especially Anglophone, given its status as the lingua franca of academia and beyond—contexts, mechanisms that tend to be rendered obscure due to the predominance of the issue of single-language interlegibility. Inspecting the postcolonial, cultural, and institutional underpinnings from which the phenomenon emerged, I read it though Rey Chow&rsquo;s theorization of &ldquo;postcolonial lanuguaging&rdquo; in the context of what Shih Shu-mei calls the Sinophone.</p>
        <p>This focus, in popular mockery of <em>ngai</em>-ABCs, on their speech and, in turn, on their voices as a voluntary performative site that works against the grain of the causality of one&rsquo;s habitus could be seen as a manifestation of Mladen Dolar&rsquo;s theorization, through Wolfgang von Klempelen&rsquo;s 1970 Sprech-Maschine, of the voice as being &ldquo;in excess of speech and meaning&rdquo; and thus a &ldquo;point of fascination&rdquo; when its &ldquo;voice-effect [is] produced … by a mysterious jump in causality, a breach, a limping causality, an excess of the voice-effect over its cause, where the voice came to occupy the space of a breach, a missing link, a gap in the causal nexus&rdquo; (2006, 10). However, taking into account Marlene Schäfers&rsquo; (2017) caution to not, then, abstractly attribute any &ldquo;universal, pre-cultural quality to the voice&rsquo;s disruptive potential,&rdquo; but rather to ground such theorizations in detailed historical and anthropological analysis, the first part of this essay will be my preliminary attempt in mapping out this recent phenomenon from scratch.</p>

        <p class="subheading">Before/Beneath/Beyond <em>ngai</em>-ABCs</p>
        <p>Although viral entities, concepts, and ideas often come with a namable shorthand, they rarely assume a singular existence. Instead, their very legibility suggests that they always-already exist as nodes of intensity among assemblages of memetic relationalities. This is to say that a concept that is able to gain any purchase as an emerging cultural phenomenon is, at the very least, locatable in the existing cultural nexus that provides it with traceable referents, yet reframed enough so as to seem new. &ldquo;<em>ngai</em>-ABC&rdquo; and &ldquo;ABC,&rdquo; the latter from which the former is derived, are no different in this regard: in this section, I put both terms in conversation with related yet dissimilar concepts that are already in circulation.</p>
        <p>My grandparents&rsquo; generation refers to ethnic Chinese individuals who grew up in English-speaking countries as &ldquo;bamboo rod boys/girls&rdquo; (zuk sing zai/neoi 竹昇仔/女). Bamboo rods, with their hollow yet enclosed (that is, &ldquo;not through&rdquo; [唔通 m tong; here meaning &ldquo;not being able to understand&rdquo;]) cells, point to their lack of knowledge in traditional Chinese culture and language despite the guise of an ethnic Chinese appearance. A similar English term in Asian American diasporic communities is &ldquo;banana&rdquo;—yellow on the outside, white on the inside. (The opposite is perhaps what Hong Kong-born actress-singer Corinna Chamberlain, whose parents emigrated from Australia and New Zealand, calls herself: &ldquo;custard bun&rdquo;—white on the outside, yellow on the inside.) Here it is necessary to note that, unlike its color-coded (read: racialized, and thus rendered ethnically ambiguous) Anglophone counterparts, &ldquo;bamboo rod boy/girl&rdquo; points to a inner lack that is not seen as being filled by gaining whiteness, although both rely on some version of essentialist logic in foregrounding a fundamental &ldquo;mismatch&rdquo; between interiority and exteriority.</p>
        <p>A related phrase, &ldquo;soaked in saltwater&rdquo; (<em>zam gwo haam seoi</em> 浸過鹹水), refers to local Hong Kongers who have studied abroad. Its allusion to a somewhat archaic mode of transnational transportation notwithstanding, it remains widely circulated to this day, usually as a compliment. This geographical demarcation by an oceanic imagination, according to Shih Shu-mei (2014), is intimately tied to European conceptions of maritime imperialism, as shown by Hegel&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;The European state is truly European only in so far as it has links to the sea&rdquo; (cited in Shih 2014, 712). This phrase, then, reveals internalized conceptions of the West and Asia binary (Sakai 2000), in which a Western education is accepted as a de facto factor in professional success. Moreover, its being in past tense hints at the expected eventual return to one&rsquo;s homeland after absorbing—soaking up—foreign culture and knowledge. Again, processes of cultural influence are foregrounded here in lieu of overt racialization.</p>
        <p>The flip side, framed in the rhetoric of contamination, is evident in the phrase <em>gwai gwai dei</em> 鬼鬼地 (&ldquo;slightly ghost-like&rdquo;). This, in turn, is derived from <em>gwai lou/po/mui/zai</em> 鬼佬/婆/妹/仔 (&ldquo;ghost dude/woman/girl/boy&rdquo;), a once-derogatory term commonly used by locals in place of the more official-sounding <em>ngoi gwok jan</em> 外國人 (&ldquo;foreign country person&rdquo;) on foreigners (usually with a lighter complexion, hence &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;). In turn, <em>gwai gwai dei</em> refers to the taking up of—or rather being haunted by—these foreigners&rsquo; mannerisms, clothing, and speech. This term thus brings and binds together ethnic Chinese individuals from disparate backgrounds who speak Cantonese with a foreign accent, including foreign-born ethnic Chinese, Hong Kongers who studied in international schools, people of mixed ethnic descent, and so on. The character <em>dei</em> (&ldquo;slightly&rdquo;) here is telling: it is precisely the partial, incomplete nature of this linguistic impurity that functions as Dolar&rsquo;s vocal excess, and thus marked as worthy of pointing out as a source of fascination and amusement.</p>

        <p class="subheading"><i><em>ngai</em></i>-ABCs</p>
        <p>It is within these complex linguistics networks that we can finally begin to situate the <em><em>ngai</em></em>-ABCs. The &ldquo;<em><em>ngai</em></em>-&rdquo; prefix, which means &ldquo;fake&rdquo; or &ldquo;pseudo-,&rdquo; necessitates reevaluating the other side of the hyphenation; that is, this adjectival appendage assumes a certain level of ontological integrity of its modified object. In other words, <em>ngai</em>-ABC is only possible if there exists a form of natural and unpretentious &ldquo;real ABCs&rdquo; against which the pretender can be effectively compared, outed, and criticized as a counterfeit.</p>
        <p>So, who are &ldquo;real ABCs&rdquo;? Although originally an acronym for American-born Chinese (which, retrospectively, points to a point of essential origin—but how can one&rsquo;s place of birth tell us anything substantial about their upbringing?), &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; gains much of its currency as a catch-all term for anyone who is gwai gwai dei, thus acquiring all of the latter term&rsquo;s ambiguities. This means that one does not have to be born in the United States, but merely speak and act like one is, to be considered as a &ldquo;real ABC.&rdquo; Subsequently, <em>ngai</em>-ABCs are those who aspire to be gwai gwai dei but fail to convince. This is a curious case of how a performativity that arises from cultural contamination (gwai gwai dei) can be repositioned as an authentic point of reference. Put this way, not only does the differentiation between the real and the fake depend on the accuser&rsquo;s self-proclaimed ability to distinguish genuine from counterfeit versions of similar performative speech acts, but the very basis of this entire enterprise is also revealed to be tautological and performative all the way down.</p>
        <p>Further complicating this centricity of performativity is very prefix itself. The character for &ldquo;fake&rdquo; 偽 happens to be a homophone of the character for &ldquo;art&rdquo;藝: both are pronounced <em>ngai</em>. In turn, &ldquo;celebrity&rdquo; (<em>ngai</em> jan 藝人, literally &ldquo;art person&rdquo;) sounds exactly the same as &ldquo;fake person&rdquo; (<em>ngai</em> jan 偽人)—a term used to criticize the carefully curated public personae of celebrities. It is unsurprising, then, that the closely related <em>ngai</em>-ABC is also rigorously developed in the context of celebrity gossip and popular culture, where the public continuously tries to identify singers who are faking it, but perhaps not quite making it.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, many successful singers are, incidentally, also &ldquo;real ABCs&rdquo; in the broader sense: this includes Janice Vidal, Fiona Sit, Kary Ng, Linda Chung, Joyce Cheng, Shiga Lin, Edison Chen, Daniel Wu, Aarif Lee, MC Jin, and many others. Among them, American-born-and-raised (thus a &ldquo;real ABC&rdquo; in the strict sense) rapper MC Jin released the award-winning album ABC in 2007, featuring the tellingly titled hits &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; and &ldquo;Speak Can&rsquo;t Read&rdquo; (sik gong m sik tai 識講唔識睇). The linguistic peculiarity of his lyrics—for instance, &ldquo;ABC hai ngo hai ngo&rdquo; (ABC 係我係我 &ldquo;ABC is me, is me&rdquo;), a literal inversion of the grammatically conventional &ldquo;ngo hai ABC&rdquo; (&ldquo;I am ABC&rdquo;)—demonstrates the referential frame through which Hong Kong singers are interpreted: one that celebrates the curious postcolonial inversion of inferiority-as-superiority, that is, not speaking Cantonese well as a source of pride, admiration, and as Dolar suggests, fascination.</p>
        <p>In contrast, and in close adherence to this value system, other singers have been mockingly called <em>ngai</em>-ABCs for trying to acquire cultural capital through such performative speech acts. The most prominent case is Janice Man (known as JM), whose distinctive linguistic inflections have been granted its own name, &ldquo;JM Tone&rdquo; (Sky Post 2016). As key opinion leader (KOL) KingJer writes in a sarcastic how-to guide, one can acquire JM Tone by following these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add &ldquo;Yea!&rdquo; between sentences for emphasis and persuasion.</li>
            <li>You must always assume that your interlocutor doesn&rsquo;t understand you, so you should provide the Cantonese meaning after using English vocabularies to reinforce your authority in English. For example, you can imitate JM and say, &ldquo;Perfume, which means <em>hoeng seoi</em> 香水.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Your R&rsquo;s must be pronounced accurately. Even if the word doesn&rsquo;t have an R, find a spot to add one in. [JM once pronounced &ldquo;cleansing foam&rdquo; as &ldquo;cleansing form&rdquo; in an interview (Hong Kong Economic Times 2016).]</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This kind of sarcastic response often seems to focus not so much on mere performativity, but the excess of performativity in the spectacle of failure. What is intriguing is that, while such attention to mistakes permeate discourses on both &ldquo;real ABCs&rdquo; and <em>ngai</em>-ABCs, they are separated by a measurement of degree. Yet, the rubric which is used to determine when someone crosses the threshold of genuineness is never provided, perhaps because it is, quite frankly, impossible to do so: because of the specific culture milieu of Hong Kong as elaborated below, any attempt to demarcate the boundaries of such speech acts will almost inevitably spiral into a form of self-critique on one&rsquo;s own sonic performativity.</p>

        <p class="subheading">Biliteracy, Trilingualism, and Postcolonial Languaging</p>
        <p>The difficulty in delineating this sonic performativity lies simply in the fact that Hong Kong Cantonese is hardly &ldquo;linguistically pure&rdquo; in any sense of the phrase. For one, it is very telling that the term &ldquo;ABC&rdquo; itself takes the form of an English acronym, belying the very postcolonial bilingualism that its parodic, derogatory variant, &ldquo;<em>ngai</em>-ABC,&rdquo; attempts to foreground and criticize. Even more ironic is how the latter term is the result of placing a Cantonese prefix onto an English acronym; the profound hypocrisy of using a linguistically hybrid term to criticize others&rsquo; insertion of English words in their Cantonese speech thus necessitates further contextualization.</p>
        <p>During the city&rsquo;s 150 years under British colonization (1842–1997), English remained, for the most part, the only official language until the addition of Chinese in 1974. Since Hong Kong&rsquo;s handover to China in 1997, the role of English has generally been sustained: as the Education Bureau (1997) states, the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;aim is for our students to be biliterate (i.e. master written Chinese and English) and trilingual (i.e. speak fluent Cantonese, Putonghua and English).&rdquo; This policy, often referred to by the shorthand &ldquo;biliterate and trilingual&rdquo; 兩文三語 (&ldquo;two written languages three spoken languages&rdquo;), resulted in Hong Kong Cantonese&rsquo;s markedly multilingual quality.</p>
        <p>In Not Like a Native Speaker: On Languaging as a Postcolonial Experience, Rey Chow reads these characteristics of postcolonial languaging as providing a promising departure from standard narratives of colonial trauma because they &ldquo;[offer] a privileged vantage point from which to view the postcolonial situation, for precisely the reason that this language [in this case, English] has been imposed from without&rdquo; (14). Central to the internalized linguistic inferiority in discourses on <em>ngai</em>-ABC is what Chow calls &ldquo;double disfigurement&rdquo;: &ldquo;a defective correction of something already deemed defective&rdquo; (8) that traverses the visual and the sonic potentialities afforded by the ambiguity of the word tone—a prime example of which is, of course, &ldquo;JM Tone.&rdquo; However, Chow takes an optimistic turn and writes, &ldquo;Rather than being signs of inferiority, … double disfigurement can be conceptualized anew as forms of unveiling, as what expose the untenability of &lsquo;proper&rsquo; (and proprietary) speech as such&rdquo; (15).</p>
        <p>Chow grounds her positive reading by foregrounding how the linguistic &ldquo;cut&rdquo; inherent in a colonial education like Hong Kong&rsquo;s can offer liberating potentials: the (self-)alienation of this cultural &ldquo;severance&rdquo; notwithstanding, &ldquo;the colonized is much closer to the truth of the mediated and divisive character of all linguistic communication&rdquo; (42). Reflecting on Michel Foucault&rsquo;s formulation of discourse (of which postcolonial languaging belongs) as a &ldquo;found object&rdquo; that is &ldquo;an assemblage of discontinuous, lived experiences or … a network composed of what may be termed the déjà énoncé&rdquo; (53), Chow argues for viewing postcolonial &ldquo;language use&rdquo; as &ldquo;a new type of act—an archiving in process&rdquo; that is &ldquo;at once particular and anonymous, at once individual and impersonal&rdquo; (56–7). To her, this &ldquo;emergent languaging domain&rdquo; she calls &ldquo;xenopohone&rdquo; unveils (in the sense of Deleuze&rsquo;s &ldquo;inherent variation&rdquo;) the intrinsic instability, discontinuity, and plurality of &ldquo;languaging&rdquo; that native speakers&rsquo; proclamations of &ldquo;primacy or originariness&rdquo; attempt to obscure (59). Might we, then, consider <em>ngai</em>-ABCs as the revolutionary par excellence in demonstrating this liberating gesture through their performative adoption of English-language speech acts?</p>

        <p class="subheading">Sinophone and the Multiplicity of Chineseness</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s approach this question from the opposite direction: What can <em>ngai</em>-ABCs reveal about Chineseness? Here, Shih Shu-mei&rsquo;s (2011) formulation of the Sinophone offers helpful points of entry. Writing in response to the scholarly practice of using &ldquo;Sinophone&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;Chinese-speaking&rdquo; or &ldquo;written in Chinese,&rdquo; Shih reclaims the term as a &ldquo;multidirectional critique&rdquo; that &ldquo;disrupts the chain of equivalence established, since the rise of nation-states, among language, culture, ethnicity, and nationality and explores the protean, kaleidoscopic, creative, and overlapping margins of China and Chineseness, America and Americanness, Malaysia and Malaysianness, Taiwan and Taiwanness, and so on, by a consideration of specific, local Sinophone texts, cultures, and practices produced in and from these margins&rdquo; (710–1). For our purposes, this implies that our discussion on a geopolitically marginal practice like <em>ngai</em>-ABC must always be positioned as an internal interrogation (akin to Chow&rsquo;s &ldquo;cut,&rdquo; but emerging from within) of the scope of what forms our imagination of &ldquo;Sinophone literature&rdquo; can take.</p>
        <p>Particularly, if we take seriously Chow&rsquo;s (2011) assertion that Hong Kong&rsquo;s postcoloniality must be considered as a &ldquo;double impossibility&rdquo; (153) in that its supposed &ldquo;return&rdquo; to its &ldquo;mother country&rdquo; is complicated by the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;impurity and an awareness of impure origins, of origins as impure,&rdquo; the <em>ngai</em>-ABC phenomenon, intriguingly, reveals itself to be an embodiment of the city&rsquo;s intricate positionality, an archetype of this exact &ldquo;double impossibility.&rdquo; As Chow succinctly puts it, &ldquo;The first thing Hong Kong needs to combat from the inside is the totalizing nativist vision of the Chinese folk&rdquo; (156); Or, as Allen Chun (1996) elegantly puts it in the title of his provocative article, &ldquo;Fuck Chineseness.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>The fundamentally linguistic and sonic problem of <em>ngai</em>-ABC, as it is manifested in contemporary Hong Kong, is thus not mere celebrity gossip; rather, as Chow argues in her discussion of postcolonial self-writing practices in the city, it &ldquo;presents a problem that is crucial but rarely discussed in postcolonial debates, namely, the struggle between the dominant and subdominant within the &lsquo;native&rsquo; culture itself&rdquo; (2011, 155). These perennial sonic negotiations—between the genuine and the counterfeit, between locals and (their sonic imaginations of) ABCs, between Cantonese and English, between embodiment and performativity—are masterfully demonstrated and, more tellingly, accentuated by <em>ngai</em>-ABCs. Rather than to continuously observe these witch-hunts, parodies, and discourse unfold in the public sphere, we might as well take the <em>ngai</em>-ABCs&rsquo; performative speech acts as a genuine provocation: an invitation to problematize our processes of linguistic taxonomy, so as to reflect, through discovering our own postcolonial languaging, on what about our speech that we can truly claim as real.</p>
