            <p class="heading">Hello!</p>
            <p>I am a PhD student in Music/Integrative Studies at UC San Diego. In 2016, I graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong with a BA in Music (First Class Honors).</p>
            <p>My writings focus on the interactions between sounds, politics, and technologies in Hong Kong in relation to critical university studies, digital humanities, and ethnic studies. Recently, I have been thinking about genealogies of undesirabilities, failures, and disjuntures, as well as the theorization potentials of anecdotes, gossips, and rumors. I like thinking in threes.</p>
            <p>Here is my <a href="cv.html">CV</a>, and here are my <a href="teaching.html">teaching materials</a>.</p>
