        <p>I am a musicologist, writer, and <a href="partners.html">thinking partner</a> in New York. My research lies at the intersection of transpacific sound/media studies, critical university studies, and gastromusicology. I have presented my work on sonic failure, musical hatred, and digital circulation at Music Archive Finland and the Universities of California, Michigan, Minnesota, and Hong Kong. In collaboration with Sarah Hankins, Suzanne Thorpe, and Juan David Rubio, I organized <a href="http://sites.google.com/view/sonicfluidities" target="_blank">Sonic Fluidities</a> (2018), a sound studies conference featuring keynotes by George Lewis, Clara Latham, Roshanak Kheshti, and David Kirsh. I am currently Associate Editor at <a href="https://www.semsn.com" target="_blank">SEM Student News</a> and a moderator at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/161177417731635/" target="_blank">Decolonizing Ethnomusicology</a>.</p>

        <p>I am a PhD student and Henry MacCracken Fellow in Ethnomusicology at New York University. I received my MA in <a href="http://musicweb.ucsd.edu/grad/grad-pages.php?i=203" target="_blank">Music/Integrative Studies</a> (2018) from UC San Diego, where my thesis, <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6231d44p" target="_blank">Frivolous Discords</a>, explored the politics of musical aversion, public dancing, and vocal timbre through viral memes in contemporary Hong Kong. I received my BA in Music (2016) with First Class Honors from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was awarded the Bernard van Zuiden Music Prize for graduating top of class. My studies were fully supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Music and Dance Fund, the Kunkle and Pommerenke Grand Scholarship, and the HKSAR Government.</p>
